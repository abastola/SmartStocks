attarticle = "The combined business would pair the carrier’s millions of wireless and pay-television subscribers with Time Warner’s deep media lineup, which includes networks such as CNN, TNT, the prized HBO channel and Warner Bros. film and TV studio. It furthers AT&T’s bet that television and video can drive growth into a stalled wireless market.“Premium content always wins. It has been true on the big screen, the TV screen and now it’s proving true on the mobile screen,” Mr. Stephenson, 56 years old, said in a release The companies said they aim to be the first U.S. wireless company to compete nationwide with cable companies by providing an online-video bundle akin to a traditional pay-television package. “It will disrupt the traditional entertainment model and push the boundaries on mobile content availability for the benefit of customers,” the companies said. For Time Warner, the deal represents a victory for Mr. Bewkes, 64, who took some heat from investors for rebuffing a takeover bid two years ago from 21st Century Fox at $85 a share. (21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal-owner News Corp share common ownership.) A major question is whether regulators will be willing to bless another major consolidation in the media industry especially after misgivings from a prior deal between Comcast Corp. and General Electric Co. ’s NBCUniversal. At the very least, former regulatory officials say there could be significant conditions placed on the combination. On a conference call Saturday night, AT&T’s Mr. Stephenson played down any regulatory roadblocks, arguing that AT&T isn’t eliminating a competitor, but rather is buying a supplier, a type of combination that isn’t blocked by regulators. “Any concerns by the regulators we believe would be adequately addressed by conditions,” he said. The companies are reviewing whether any of Time Warner’s licenses will be transferred under the deal, requiring a review by the Federal Communications Commission. Competitors are likely to sound alarms about the scale of the combined company to possibly extract concessions during the review. Walt Disney Co. Chief Communications Officer Zenia Mucha said Saturday that “a transaction of this magnitude obviously warrants very close regulatory scrutiny.” Mr. Stephenson added that Time Warner had created an “amazing franchise” by distributing its content to many distributors, and “we don’t imagine that changing.” The talks began in August, when Mr. Stephenson paid a visit to Mr. Bewkes at Time Warner’s New York offices. “He came to talk to me about his view of distribution going forward, and my view of content,” Mr. Bewkes said in an interview after the deal was announced late Saturday. “He said, ‘conceptually it might make sense for us to combine. Should we investigate?’ ” The first hurdle was getting Time Warner interested in selling. The men continued discussing the possibilities with each other and talked to their boards, eventually concluding that a merger made sense, Mr. Bewkes said. Time Warner has experience in trying to marry internet and media assets before with its blockbuster cross-industry combination, the 2000 merger with AOL, which became a case study of what can go wrong in an ambitious deal. Mr. Bewkes said a big difference from the AOL days is that distribution has become even more central to giving consumers what they demand from media—more flexibility in the packages they can buy, and the platforms they can accesses content from. “There’s more video going on mobile,” Mr. Bewkes said. Mr. Bewkes said on the conference call Saturday night that he plans to stay on for “a reasonable period of time” after the deal closes, adding that he expected “basically all” of Time Warner’s business and creative executives to remain at the company for many year For AT&T, the deal will help the carrier potentially find new areas of growth as its core wireless business has become saturated and its market share leaves little room for acquisitions. On Saturday the carrier released its quarterly financial results, providing a view of the pressures its traditional wireless business faces. The carrier lost 268,000 mainstream wireless phone customers and its video business lost a net 3,000 customers in the quarter, as additions in the DirecTV business failed to surpass the losses in its older U-Verse service. The company has lost almost 200,000 video customers since buying satellite television provider DirecTV last year. The transaction would be far and away the biggest media deal of recent years, potentially breathing new life into media deal-making. Time Warner had a market capitalization of $68 billion before the Journal reported on the advanced talks Friday, while AT&T’s was $233 billion. For AT&T, the deal would eclipse the nearly $50 billion DirecTV deal and may be its biggest acquisition since paying $85 billion for BellSouth in 2006. If completed, Dallas-based AT&T would rely on its entertainment business for more than 40% of its revenue, based on second-quarter financial results, strongly diversifying the company away from a U.S. wireless business that has become increasing competitive. With its newfound scale from the DirecTV acquisition, AT&T has spent the past year aggressively negotiating deals with content owners and plans to launch an over-the-top video service by year’s end, which would allow users to stream programming over the Web without the need for a satellite dish. Mr. Stephenson described those negotiations as “really hard and really slow.” “Jeff and I have a vision that if you put these things together, you can iterate and develop content differently for these new platforms,” Mr. Stephenson said on the call. Time Warner has agreed to pay a $1.7 billion breakup fee if another company outbids AT&T’s offer, a person familiar with the plans said. AT&T, meanwhile, would pay $500 million if the deal gets blocked, this person said. AT&T will tap $40 billion in bridge loans, the person said, with $25 billion coming from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and $15 billion from Bank of America Corp. The carrier said it is committed to maintaining its investment-grade credit ratings and forecast that the deal will lead to about $1 billion in cost savings within the three years. Corrections & Amplifications: Bank of America Merrill Lynch is expected to provide AT&T with a $15 billion bridge loan. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the amount the bank would provide. (Oct. 22, 2016)"
wfgarticle = "Everyone hates paying bank fees. But imagine paying fees on a ghost account you didn't even sign up for. That's exactly what happened to Wells Fargo customers nationwide. On Thursday, federal regulators said Wells Fargo (WFC) employees secretly created millions of unauthorized bank and credit card accounts -- without their customers knowing it -- since 2011. Powered by SmartAsset.com MORTGAGE RATES BY MORTGAGE RATES BY The phony accounts earned the bank unwarranted fees and allowed Wells Fargo employees to boost their sales figures and make more money. Wells Fargo employees secretly opened unauthorized accounts to hit sales targets and receive bonuses, Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said in a statement. Wells Fargo confirmed to CNNMoney that it had fired 5,300 employees over the last few years related to the shady behavior. Employees went so far as to create phony PIN numbers and fake email addresses to enroll customers in online banking services, the CFPB said. The eof the scandal is shocking. An analysis conducted by a consulting firm hired by Wells Fargo concluded that bank employees opened over 1.5 million deposit accounts that may not have been authorized. The way it worked was that employees moved funds from customers' existing accounts into newly-created ones without their knowledge or consent, regulators say. The CFPB described this practice as widespread. Customers were being charged for insufficient funds or overdraft fees -- because there wasn't enough money in their original accounts. Additionally, Wells Fargo employees also submitted applications for 565,443 credit card accounts without their customers' knowledge or consent. Roughly 14,000 of those accounts incurred over $400,000 in fees, including annual fees, interest charges and overdraft-protection fees. The CFPB said Wells Fargo will pay full restitutions to all victims. Wells Fargo is being slapped with the largest penalty since the CFPB was founded in 2011. The bank agreed to pay $185 million in fines, along with $5 million to refund customers. We regret and take responsibility for any instances where customers may have received a product that they did not request, Wells Fargo said in a statement. Wells Fargo has the highest market valuation among any bank in America, worth just north of $250 billion. Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), the investment firm run legendary investor Warren Buffett, is the company's biggest shareholder. Of the total fines, $100 million will go toward the CFPB's Civil Penalty Fund, $35 million will go to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and another $50 million will be paid to the City and County of Los Angeles. One wonders whether (the CFPB) penalty of $100 million is enough, said David Vladeck, a Georgetown University law professor and former director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection. It sounds like a big number, but for a bank the size of Wells Fargo, it isn't really. Wells Fargo confirmed to CNNMoney that the 5,300 firings took place over several years. The bank listed 265,000 employees as of the end of 2015. Related: Barclays fined $109 million for trying to hide a deal with rich clients At Wells Fargo, when we make mistakes, we are open about it, we take responsibility, and we take action, the bank said in a memo to employees on Thursday. The CFPB declined to comment on when the investigation began and what sparked it, citing agency policy. We don't comment on how we uncover these matters, a spokesman said. As part of the settlement, Wells Fargo needs to make changes to its sales practices and internal oversight. Customers are fuming. Brian Kennedy, a Maryland retiree, told CNNMoney he detected an unauthorized Wells Fargo account had been created in his name about a year ago. He asked Wells Fargo about it and the bank closed it, he said. I didn't sign up for any bloody checking account, Kennedy, who is 57 years old, told CNNMoney. They lost me as a banking customer and I have warned family and friends." "Consumers must be able to trust their banks, said Mike Feuer, the Los Angeles City Attorney who joined the settlement. Feuer's office sued Wells Fargo in May 2015 over allegations of unauthorized accounts. After filing the suit, his office received more than 1,000 calls and emails from customers as well as current and former Wells Fargo employees about the allegations. Wells Fargo declined to say when it hired a consulting firm to investigate the allegations. However, a person familiar with the matter told CNNMoney the bank launched the review after the L.A. lawsuit was filed. Even though the Wells Fargo scandal took place nationally, the settlement with L.A. requires the bank to specifically alert all its California customers to review their accounts and shut down ones they don't recognize or want. How does a bank that is supposed to have robust internal controls permit the creation of over a half-million dummy accounts? asked Vladeck. If I were a Wells Fargo customer, and fortunately I am not, I'd think seriously about finding a new bank. "
