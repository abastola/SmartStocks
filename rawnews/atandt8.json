Playing in the second round of the A.T.&T. Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, across the links he regularly trod as a student at nearby Stanford, Watson rekindled the relationship and restarted his golf game. Watson, 44, shot an airtight round of 67 that was as cool and flawless as the day that embraced the Monterey Peninsula. He didn't bogey a hole, and begins the weekend one stroke behind the leader, Davis Love 3d, who had seven birdies in a round of 66 and stands alone at 135, 9 under par.\",\"abstract\":null,\"print_page\":\"33\",\"blog\":[],\"source\":\"The New York Times\",\"multimedia\":[],\"headline\":{\"main\":\"Watson Finds Game Where It All Began\",\"kicker\":\"GOLF\"},\"keywords\":[{\"name\":\"glocations\",\"value\":\"PEBBLE BEACH (CALIF)\"},{\"name\":\"subject\",\"value\":\"AT&T NATIONAL PRO-AM GOLF TOURNAMENT\"},{\"name\":\"subject\",\"value\":\"GOLF\"}],\"pub_date\":\"1994-02-05T00:00:00Z\",\"document_type\":\"article\",\"news_desk\":\"Sports Desk\",\"section_name\":\"Sports\",\"subsection_name\":null,\"byline\":{\"person\":[{\"organization\":\"\",\"role\":\"reported\",\"firstname\":\"Larry\",\"rank\":1,\"lastname\":\"DORMAN\"}],\"original\":\"By LARRY DORMAN\"},\"type_of_material\":\"News\",\"_id\":\"4fd1eae68eb7c8105d73b134\",\"word_count\":609,\"slideshow_credits\":null},{\"web_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/2001\\/07\\/09\\/business\\/market-place-t-wireless-strikes-its-own-other-bits-pieces-t-remain-play.html\",\"snippet\":\"THE complex breakup of AT&T could become a bit less complicated today when the company plans to complete its spinoff of AT&T Wireless to shareholders.

By the mid-90's it even crept into highbrow American musical culture, via the album ''The Soul of Black Peru,'' an anthology put together by the Luaka Bop label. Susana Baca, one singer featured on that collection, has since gained a small but deep American art-music following through a few American-released Luaka Bop albums that have stripped down her music to its rhythmic-melodic essentials and added guest musicians from the jazz and rock worlds like Marc Ribot and John Medeski. But the career of Eva Ayllon, another singer featured on that record, has not thrived here, and from her performance at Queens Theater in the Park on Tuesday, part of the AT&T Latino Cultural Festival 2000, it was easy to see why. It's not for lack of talent: Ms. Ayllon, who is in her mid-40's and whose career began in the late 70's, is a strong and outrageously good singer. It's that her music has the temper of out-and-out romantic pop, which can be hard for those outside its cultural references to grasp. Still, Ms. Baca makes an ingenious cross between folklore and highbrow art music, two concepts that the American ''world music'' audience well understands.\",\"abstract\":\"Ben Ratliff reviews the Afro-Peruvian pop singer Eva Allyon at Queens Theater in the Park, part of AT&T Latino Cultural Festival 2000; photo (M)\",\"print_page\":\"5\",\"blog\":[],\"source\":\"The New York Times\",\"multimedia\":[],\"headline\":{\"main\":\"Romance Leavened With Highbrow Folklore\",\"kicker\":\"POP REVIEW\"},\"keywords\":[{\"name\":\"persons\",\"value\":\"ALLYON, EVA\"},{\"name\":\"subject\",\"value\":\"MUSIC\"},{\"name\":\"subject\",\"value\":\"REVIEWS\"},{\"name\":\"subject\",\"value\":\"AT&T LATINO CULTURAL FESTIVAL\"}],\"pub_date\":\"2000-08-03T00:00:00Z\",\"document_type\":\"article\",\"news_desk\":\"The Arts\\/Cultural Desk\",\"section_name\":\"Arts\",\"subsection_name\":null,\"byline\":{\"person\":[{\"organization\":\"\",\"role\":\"reported\",\"firstname\":\"Ben\",\"rank\":1,\"lastname\":\"RATLIFF\"}],\"original\":\"By BEN RATLIFF\"},\"type_of_material\":\"Review\",\"_id\":\"4fd219c98eb7c8105d797d19\",\"word_count\":509,\"slideshow_credits\":null},{\"web_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/2016\\/09\\/07\\/arts\\/television\\/mr-robot-season-2-episode-10-recap.html\",\"snippet\":\"The ugliest scene in this week\\u2019s episode is also its most elegantly constructed.\",\"lead_paragraph\":\"The ugliest scene in this week\\u2019s episode is also its most elegantly constructed.\",\"abstract\":null,\"print_page\":null,\"blog\":[],\"source\":\"The New York Times\",\"multimedia\":[{\"width\":190,\"url\":\"images\\/2016\\/09\\/07\\/watching\\/07robot\\/07robot-thumbWide.jpg\",\"height\":126,\"subtype\":\"wide\",\"legacy\":{\"wide\":\"images\\/2016\\/09\\/07\\/watching\\/07robot\\/07robot-thumbWide.jpg\",\"wideheight\":\"126\",\"widewidth\":\"190\"},\"type\":\"image\"},{\"width\":600,\"url\":\"images\\/2016\\/09\\/07\\/watching\\/07robot\\/07robot-articleLarge.jpg\",\"height\":401,\"subtype\":\"xlarge\",\"legacy\":{\"xlargewidth\":\"600\",\"xlarge\":\"images\\/2016\\/09\\/07\\/watching\\/07robot\\/07robot-articleLarge.jpg\",\"xlargeheight\":\"401\"},\"type\":\"image\"},{\"width\":75,\"url\":\"images\\/2016\\/09\\/07\\/watching\\/07robot\\/07robot-thumbStandard.jpg\",\"height\":75,\"subtype\":\"thumbnail\",\"legacy\":{\"thumbnailheight\":\"75\",\"thumbnail\":\"images\\/2016\\/09\\/07\\/watching\\/07robot\\/07robot-thumbStandard.jpg\",\"thumbnailwidth\":\"75\"},\"type\":\"image\"}],\"headline\":{\"main\":\"\\u2018Mr. Robot\\u2019 Season 2, Episode 10: Anatomy of a Murder\",\"content_kicker\":\"Mr. Robot\",\"kicker\":\"Mr. Robot\"},\"keywords\":[{\"rank\":\"1\",\"is_major\":\"N\",\"name\":\"subject\",\"value\":\"Television\"},{\"rank\":\"2\",\"is_major\":\"N\",\"name\":\"creative_works\",\"value\":\"Mr Robot (TV Program)\"}],\"pub_date\":\"2016-09-07T00:00:00Z\",\"document_type\":\"article\",\"news_desk\":\"Culture\",\"section_name\":\"Arts\",\"subsection_name\":\"Television\",\"byline\":{\"person\":[{\"firstname\":\"Sean\",\"middlename\":\"T.\",\"lastname\":\"COLLINS\",\"rank\":1,\"role\":\"reported\",\"organization\":\"\"}],\"original\":\"By SEAN T.
