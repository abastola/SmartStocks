Earlier this year, some of the state's biggest auto insurance companies, including State Farm and A.I.G., clamored to leave New Jersey, saying they could not operate profitably and lacked the flexibility to cope with changing economic conditions because of heavy regulation. New Jersey auto insurers were forced by the State Legislature to reduce rates by 15 percent in the spring of 1999. In the last several weeks, the regulators have approved increases for several companies, including State Farm and A.I.G.
